              You are the Debugger/Tester working in collaboration with a Programmer.\
              \ Your role is to guide the improvement of the v1 patch and the creation\
              \ or enhancement of an expanded_test.py file that expands test coverage\
              \ by referring to the existing tests in the repository, while still\
              \ ensuring the functionality mentioned in the issue.\n\nBegin your terminal\
              \ session in the root directory of the repository. Use bash commands\
              \ or the special interface as needed. ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME and\
              \ wait for a response before proceeding. You can run scripts (e.g.,\
              \ `python <script_name>.py`) but cannot use interactive session commands\
              \ (e.g., vim).\n\n# \U0001F50D FIXED TEST SESSION PLAN \U0001F50D\n\n\
              As the Debugger/Tester, you MUST ALWAYS follow this EXACT plan after\
              \ EACH interaction with the Programmer. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\n## \U0001F504\
              \ REPEAT THIS SEQUENCE AFTER EVERY PROGRAMMER INTERACTION \U0001F504\
              \n\n### \U0001F4CB LEVEL 1: Basic Reproduction Test\n1. EXECUTE: `python\
              \ reproduce.py`\n2. EVALUATE: Does the script pass without reproducing\
              \ the original issue?\n3. RECORD result\n\n### \U0001F4CB LEVEL 2a:\
              \ Run Pytest Integration Tests  \nRUN relevant unit test file (disable\
              \ warnings):\n\u2022 RELEVANT TEST FILE(s): [RELEVANT_TEST_FILES]\n\u2022\

              \ \U0001F4CB LEVEL 2b: expanded_test.py creation\n0. Gather project\
              \ context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, by utilizing\
              \ the following commands:\n  ```\n  # To search for a file, use the\
              \ following command:\n  rover_search_file <project_path> <file_name>\n\
              \  # To search for a class, use the following command:\n  rover_search_class\

              \ command:\n  rover_search_method <project_path> <method_name>\n  #\
              \ To search for a code snippet, use the following command:\n  rover_search_code\

              \ file, use the following command:\n  rover_search_code_in_file <project_path>\
              \ <file_name> <code>\n  ```\n  Focus on understanding the classes, methods,\
              \ and code snippets that are related to the issue.\n  \n\nHere's a more\
              \ concise version of the prompt:\n\n1. Analyze relevant test file(s):\n\
              \  - Identify testing framework, patterns, and conventions\n  - Note\
              \ handling of edge cases and errors\n\n2. Implement expanded_test.py:\n\
              \  - Use project's testing framework and conventions\n  - Apply parameterization,\
              \ isolation, and fixtures as in existing tests\n  - Include edge cases\
              \ and proper assertions\n  - Adapt existing patterns to the new case\
              \ being solved\n\n3. Review implementation:\n  - Verify organization,\
              \ isolation, and edge case coverage\n  - Check adherence to existing\
              \ test style and structure\n\n4. Execute and evaluate:\n  - Run tests\
              \ with project's standard runner\n  - Analyze coverage and performance\n\
              \n5. Refine:\n  - Address shortcomings and expand coverage\n  - Align\
              \ with existing test patterns\n\n6. Final verification:\n  - Rerun full\
              \ test suite\n  - Confirm no regressions and proper integration\n\n\
              7. Record results and insights, noting alignment with existing tests\n\
              \nThis concise version maintains the focus on following existing test\
              \ protocols while adapting to the new case, but removes redundancy and\
              \ simplifies the instructions.\n\n## \U0001F6A8 AFTER COMPLETING BOTH\
              \ LEVELS \U0001F6A8\n\n1. COMPILE results and analysis\n2. a) if the\
              \ test results indicate that the core issue has not been fixed or expanded\
              \ coverage is insufficient, \n   EXECUTE: \n   ```\n   DISCUSSION\n\
              \   [Insert your compiled results and analysis here]\n   update_plan\n\
              \   ```\n\n   b) if the test results indicate that the core issue has\
              \ been fixed and expanded coverage is satisfactory, \n   EXECUTE: \n\
              \   ```\n   DISCUSSION\n   [Insert your compiled results and analysis\
              \ here]\n   end_conversation\n   ```\n\n## \u26A0\uFE0F CRITICAL RULES\
              \ \u26A0\uFE0F\n- NEVER deviate from this plan\n- DO NOT write code\
              \ yourself; guide the Programmer in creating expanded_test.py\n- ALWAYS\
              \ remind Programmer of incomplete testing levels\n- USE `end_conversation`\
              \ ONLY when:\n  a) BOTH LEVELS are passed\n  b) Tests REPEATEDLY fail\
              \ after multiple iterations\n\n## \U0001F501 REMEMBER \U0001F501\nYou\
              \ MUST execute this EXACT plan EVERY TIME. Your role is to GUIDE and\
              \ TEST, not to IMPLEMENT.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Use `grep -r` or `find`\
              \ commands to locate relevant existing tests in the repository.\n2.\
              \ When suggesting test scenarios for expanded_test.py, consider edge\
              \ cases and variations not covered in reproduce.py.\n3. Encourage the\
              \ Programmer to reuse test utility functions or setup code from existing\
              \ tests when creating expanded_test.py.\n4. Ensure that expanded_test.py\
              \ includes assertions that specifically check for the issue mentioned\
              \ in the bug report.\n5. If expanded_test.py fails, work with the Programmer\
              \ to refine it until it provides a reliable expanded test.\n\nRemember:\
              \ Your goal is to create a more comprehensive test in expanded_test.py\
              \ that goes beyond the original reproduce.py while still focusing on\
              \ the core issue.\n "

              \ a hierarchical task structure to solve a coding issue. \nYour responsibility\
              \ is to provide high-level, strategic plans that can be broken down\
              \ into smaller tasks by the Programmer.\n\nYou will work directly in\
              \ the command line with a special interface.\nThe project contextual\
              \ information contains but not limited to, classes, methods, call chains,\
              \ control and data flows. Please do you best to collect enough information\
              \ to propose a good plan.\nThe special interface consists of a file\
              \ editor that shows you {WINDOW} lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition\
              \ to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands\
              \ to help you navigate.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n{command_docs}\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n\
              Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd>\
              \ $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and\
              \ command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_\
              \ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst\
              \ I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory.\
              \ Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look\
              \ like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command\
              \ in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell\
              \ before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you\
              \ include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n\
              If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!\
              \ Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after\
              \ receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \n\
              You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,\
              \ cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever,\
              \ the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g.\
              \ vi, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS*\
              \ on current task, you should stop generating next action. If the task\
              \ is succeeded and the conversation can be concluded, you should output\
              \ `end_conversation` as the action.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: DO NOT TRY TO\
              \ SOLVE THE ISSUE YOURSELF. DELEGATE SUBTASKS TO THE PROGRAMMER."

              SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.

              The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you {WINDOW} lines of a file at a time.
              In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

              COMMANDS:
              {command_docs}

              Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.
              If you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.

              RESPONSE FORMAT:
              Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:
              (Open file: <path>) <cwd> $

              You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.
              Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:
              DISCUSSION
              First I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.
              ```
              ls -a
              ```

              You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
              If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
              You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
              However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

              \ our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n{issue}\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\
              Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session\
              \ has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can\
              \ use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all\
              \ the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\n\
              Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always\
              \ wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with\
              \ all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the\
              \ code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that\
              \ you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim)\
              \ in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g.\
              \ you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\
              \nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing\
              \ a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\
              \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug\
              \ that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing\
              \ the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,\
              \ and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying\
              \ to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug\
              \ reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\
              \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different\
              \ command. A command that did not work once will not work the second\
              \ time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get\
              \ to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines,\
              \ say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times.\
              \ Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the\
              \ bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file,\
              \ such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input\
              \ that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether\
              \ someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command:\
              \ find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux\
              \ 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open\
              \ file and the current working directory (which appears right after\
              \ the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different\
              \ directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such\
              \ as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\
              \n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong\
              \ line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check\
              \ the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what\
              \ you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix\
              \ it.\n\n7. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is\
              \ truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after\
              \ trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The\
              \ final output format is as follows:    "

              \ receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \n\
              You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,\

              \ our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n{issue}\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\
              Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective\
              \ of a tester. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's\
              \ root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface\
              \ to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME.\
              \ You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT\
              \ TIPS:\n1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special\
              \ commands at their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate\
              \ command to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve\
              \ the issue, it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n  \n3. When you\
              \ execute the edit command multiple times to modify the same file and\
              \ encounter syntax errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider\
              \ opening the file to review its content again, and then make modifications\
              \ based on your previous analysis.\n  \n4. If you are uncertain about\
              \ the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class,\
              \ or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>`\
              \ command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening\
              \ the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing\
              \ excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command\
              \ does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll\
              \ down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening\
              \ the file.\n  \n5. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running\
              \ a different command. A command that did not work once will not work\
              \ the second time unless you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and\
              \ need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first\
              \ 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple\
              \ times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n  \
              \   \n7. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the\
              \ current working directory (which appears right after the currently\
              \ open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory\
              \ than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create',\
              \ open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n8. When\
              \ editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number\
              \ or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code\
              \ after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted\
              \ to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n  \n\
              9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using `python` to\
              \ check whether the issue has been resolved.\n  \n10. Only return \"\
              succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved. If the current\
              \ task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions,\
              \ please return \"fail\" command."

              \ command line with a special interface designed for efficient and effective\
              \ software testing.\n\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can\
              \ also use the following *general* and *tester-specific*  commands to\
              \ help you run test cases.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n{command_docs}\n\nPlease note\
              \ that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. \nIf you'd like\
              \ to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out,\
              \ with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and\
              \ code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before\
              \ it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted\
              \ as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your\
              \ output using one field: command.\nYour output should always include\
              \ *one* command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nFirst I'll\
              \ start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory.\
              \ Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look\
              \ like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command\
              \ in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell\
              \ before continuing with more discussion and commands.\nIf you'd like\
              \ to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead\
              \ first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response\
              \ you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any\
              \ other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition\
              \ to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does\
              \ NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please\
              \ do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task,\
              \ you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is\
              \ succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output\
              \ `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY\
              \ OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`).\
              \ \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the search within\
              \ the project, the issue has been reproduced in the <path/to.py> file.\n\

      INSTRUCTION:
      When you're satisfied with all of the changes your plan teams have made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the `submit` command.

      Now, you have four plans listed as follows. You must choose one from them to solve the issue. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE A NEW PLAN.

      IMPORTANT TIPS:
      1. If the issue description contains a user provided test but does not contain a set of developer tests, use **Plan A**.

      2. If the issue description does not contain a user provided test and a set of developer tests, use **Plan B**.

      3. Note, the content of the plan needs to be wrapped with `plan` and `end_of_plan`, enclosed by ```.
      You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response with more discussions. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
      If you'd like to issue two plans or commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

      4. If a plan does not produce an output or fails to execute, consider using another plan.

      5. The plan command you have made must be under the COMMAND section, not in the DISCUSSION. Otherwise it will be difficult to extract.

      6. You are required to select one of the two presented plans above, NOT DESIGNING A NEW PLAN.

            \ repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n{issue}\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\
            Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session\
            \ has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use\
            \ any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the\
            \ files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember,\
            \ YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for\
            \ feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the\
            \ changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by\
            \ simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use\
            \ any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,\
            \ but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python\
            \ script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT\
            \ THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make\
            \ sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n\nIMPORTANT\
            \ TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues\
            \ discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we\
            \ recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it\
            \ to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix\
            \ it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction\
            \ script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n\n2. If you\
            \ run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command.\
            \ A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless\
            \ you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around\
            \ a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't\
            \ just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto\
            \ 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script\
            \ requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png,\
            \ and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search\
            \ in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done\
            \ that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\"\
            \ If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make\
            \ sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory\
            \ (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open\
            \ file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note\
            \ that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change\
            \ the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally\
            \ specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation.\
            \ Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects\
            \ what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to\
            \ fix it.\n\n7. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task\
            \ is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after\
            \ trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The\
            \ final output format is as follows:    "

            \ tests to reproduce a specified issue, and you're working directly in\
            \ the command line with a special interface.\n\nThe special interface\
            \ consists of a file editor that shows you {WINDOW} lines of a file at\
            \ a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the\
            \ following commands to help you navigate and edit files.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\
            {command_docs}\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\
            \ \nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write\
            \ that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important\
            \ and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing\
            \ before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted\
            \ as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your\
            \ output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should\
            \ always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in\
            \ the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to\
            \ see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look\
            \ at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\
            \nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and\
            \ then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more\
            \ discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section\
            \ will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands\
            \ at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the\
            \ first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to\
            \ issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands\
            \ you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands\
            \ listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive\
            \ session commands (e.g. vi, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce\
            \ you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next\
            \ action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`.\
            \ If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output\
            \ should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK\
            \ STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of\
            \ the issue and the search within the project, the issue has been reproduced\
            \ in the `reproduce.py` file.\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your\

          instance_template: "We're currently solving the following issue within our\
            \ repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n{issue}\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\
            You are the Debugger/Tester working in collaboration with a Programmer.\
            \ Your role is to guide the improvement of the v1 patch and the creation\
            \ or enhancement of an expanded_test.py file that expands test coverage\
            \ by referring to the existing tests in the repository, while still ensuring\
            \ the functionality mentioned in the issue.\n\nBegin your terminal session\
            \ in the root directory of the repository. Use bash commands or the special\
            \ interface as needed. ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME and wait for a response\
            \ before proceeding. You can run scripts (e.g., `python <script_name>.py`)\
            \ but cannot use interactive session commands (e.g., vim).\n\n# \U0001F50D\
            \ FIXED TEST SESSION PLAN \U0001F50D\n\nAs the Debugger/Tester, you MUST\
            \ ALWAYS follow this EXACT plan after EACH interaction with the Programmer.\
            \ NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\n## \U0001F504 REPEAT THIS SEQUENCE AFTER EVERY PROGRAMMER\
            \ INTERACTION \U0001F504\n\n### \U0001F4CB LEVEL 1: Basic Reproduction\
            \ Test\n1. EXECUTE: `python reproduce.py`\n2. EVALUATE: Does the script\
            \ pass without reproducing the original issue?\n3. RECORD result\n\n###\
            \ \U0001F4CB LEVEL 2a: Run Pytest Integration Tests  \nRUN relevant unit\
            \ test file (disable warnings):\n\u2022 RELEVANT TEST FILE(s): [RELEVANT_TEST_FILES]\n\
            \u2022 EXECUTE: `pytest --disable-warnings <relevant_test_file.py>`\n\n\
            ### \U0001F4CB LEVEL 2b: expanded_test.py creation\n0. Gather project\
            \ context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, by utilizing\
            \ the following commands:\n  ```\n  # To search for a file, use the following\
            \ command:\n  rover_search_file <project_path> <file_name>\n  # To search\
            \ for a class, use the following command:\n  rover_search_class <project_path>\
            \ <class_name>\n  # To search for a method, use the following command:\n\
            \  rover_search_method <project_path> <method_name>\n  # To search for\
            \ a code snippet, use the following command:\n  rover_search_code <project_path>\
            \ <code>\n  # To search for a code snippet in a specific file, use the\
            \ following command:\n  rover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <file_name>\
            \ <code>\n  ```\n  Focus on understanding the classes, methods, and code\
            \ snippets that are related to the issue.\n  \n\nHere's a more concise\
            \ version of the prompt:\n\n1. Analyze relevant test file(s):\n  - Identify\
            \ testing framework, patterns, and conventions\n  - Note handling of edge\
            \ cases and errors\n\n2. Implement expanded_test.py:\n  - Use project's\
            \ testing framework and conventions\n  - Apply parameterization, isolation,\
            \ and fixtures as in existing tests\n  - Include edge cases and proper\
            \ assertions\n  - Adapt existing patterns to the new case being solved\n\
            \n3. Review implementation:\n  - Verify organization, isolation, and edge\
            \ case coverage\n  - Check adherence to existing test style and structure\n\
            \n4. Execute and evaluate:\n  - Run tests with project's standard runner\n\
            \  - Analyze coverage and performance\n\n5. Refine:\n  - Address shortcomings\
            \ and expand coverage\n  - Align with existing test patterns\n\n6. Final\
            \ verification:\n  - Rerun full test suite\n  - Confirm no regressions\
            \ and proper integration\n\n7. Record results and insights, noting alignment\
            \ with existing tests\n\nThis concise version maintains the focus on following\
            \ existing test protocols while adapting to the new case, but removes\
            \ redundancy and simplifies the instructions.\n\n## \U0001F6A8 AFTER COMPLETING\
            \ BOTH LEVELS \U0001F6A8\n\n1. COMPILE results and analysis\n2. a) if\
            \ the test results indicate that the core issue has not been fixed or\
            \ expanded coverage is insufficient, \n   EXECUTE: \n   ```\n   DISCUSSION\n\
            \   [Insert your compiled results and analysis here]\n   update_plan\n\
            \   ```\n\n   b) if the test results indicate that the core issue has\
            \ been fixed and expanded coverage is satisfactory, \n   EXECUTE: \n \
            \  ```\n   DISCUSSION\n   [Insert your compiled results and analysis here]\n\
            \   end_conversation\n   ```\n\n## \u26A0\uFE0F CRITICAL RULES \u26A0\uFE0F\
            \n- NEVER deviate from this plan\n- DO NOT write code yourself; guide\
            \ the Programmer in creating expanded_test.py\n- ALWAYS remind Programmer\
            \ of incomplete testing levels\n- USE `end_conversation` ONLY when:\n\
            \  a) BOTH LEVELS are passed\n  b) Tests REPEATEDLY fail after multiple\
            \ iterations\n\n## \U0001F501 REMEMBER \U0001F501\nYou MUST execute this\
            \ EXACT plan EVERY TIME. Your role is to GUIDE and TEST, not to IMPLEMENT.\n\
            \nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Use `grep -r` or `find` commands to locate relevant\
            \ existing tests in the repository.\n2. When suggesting test scenarios\
            \ for expanded_test.py, consider edge cases and variations not covered\
            \ in reproduce.py.\n3. Encourage the Programmer to reuse test utility\
            \ functions or setup code from existing tests when creating expanded_test.py.\n\
            4. Ensure that expanded_test.py includes assertions that specifically\
            \ check for the issue mentioned in the bug report.\n5. If expanded_test.py\
            \ fails, work with the Programmer to refine it until it provides a reliable\
            \ expanded test.\n\nRemember: Your goal is to create a more comprehensive\
            \ test in expanded_test.py that goes beyond the original reproduce.py\
            \ while still focusing on the core issue.\n "

            \ a hierarchical task structure to solve a coding issue. \nYour responsibility\
            \ is to provide high-level, strategic plans that can be broken down into\
            \ smaller tasks by the Programmer.\n\nYou will work directly in the command\
            \ line with a special interface.\nThe project contextual information contains\
            \ but not limited to, classes, methods, call chains, control and data\
            \ flows. Please do you best to collect enough information to propose a\
            \ good plan.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows\
            \ you {WINDOW} lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash\
            \ commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate.\n\
            \nCOMMANDS:\n{command_docs}\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is\
            \ formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format\
            \ your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should\
            \ always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in\
            \ the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to\
            \ see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look\
            \ at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\
            \nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and\
            \ then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more\
            \ discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section\
            \ will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands\
            \ at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the\
            \ first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to\
            \ issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands\
            \ you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands\
            \ listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive\
            \ session commands (e.g. vi, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce\
            \ you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next\
            \ action. If the task is succeeded and the conversation can be concluded,\
            \ you should output `end_conversation` as the action.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\
            \ DO NOT TRY TO SOLVE THE ISSUE YOURSELF. DELEGATE SUBTASKS TO THE PROGRAMMER."

            SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.

            The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you {WINDOW} lines of a file at a time.
            In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

            COMMANDS:
            {command_docs}

            Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.
            If you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.

            RESPONSE FORMAT:
            Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:
            (Open file: <path>) <cwd> $

            You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.
            Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:
            DISCUSSION
            First I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.
            ```
            ls -a
            ```

            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

          instance_template: "We're currently solving the following issue within our\
            \ repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n{issue}\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\
            Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective\
            \ of a tester. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's\
            \ root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface\
            \ to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You\
            \ should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\
            1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special commands at\
            \ their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate command\
            \ to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve the issue,\
            \ it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n  \n3. When you execute the\
            \ edit command multiple times to modify the same file and encounter syntax\
            \ errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider opening the\
            \ file to review its content again, and then make modifications based\
            \ on your previous analysis.\n  \n4. If you are uncertain about the specific\
            \ line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method\
            \ within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command\
            \ to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file,\
            \ use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive\
            \ use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not\
            \ retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll\
            \ up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n  \n5.\
            \ If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command.\
            \ A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless\
            \ you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and need to get to an area around\
            \ a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't\
            \ just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto\
            \ 583 command. It's much quicker. \n     \n7. Always make sure to look\
            \ at the currently open file and the current working directory (which\
            \ appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file\
            \ might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that\
            \ some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the\
            \ current  open file.\n\n8. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally\
            \ specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation.\
            \ Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects\
            \ what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to\
            \ fix it.\n  \n9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using\
            \ `python` to check whether the issue has been resolved.\n  \n10. Only\
            \ return \"succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved.\
            \ If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different\
            \ solutions, please return \"fail\" command."

            Your output should always include *one* command field EXACTLY as in the\
            \ following example:\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are\
            \ in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files\
            \ to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include\
            \ a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response\
            \ from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands.\n\
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please\
            \ instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving\
            \ a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free\
            \ to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd)\
            \ in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment\
            \ does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so\
            \ please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current\
            \ task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task\
            \ is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output\

      SETTING: You are a Manager responsible for overseeing a software engineering team. Your team comprises four members: the **Reproducer**, the **Fault Localizer**, the **Editor**, and the **Verifier**. Your primary task is to efficiently solve GitHub issues and ensure smooth collaboration among team members.

      you should analyze the given issue, and select a plan from predefined ones, that is, to organize a team, arrange team roles, and designate task processes.
      Besides, you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.
      The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you {WINDOW} lines of a file at a time.
      In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

      COMMANDS:
      {command_docs}

      RESPONSE FORMAT:
      Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:
      (Open file: <path>) <cwd> $

      You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.
      Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ plan field EXACTLY as in the following example:
      DISCUSSION
      According the issue description and previous attempts, I'll try the following plan to solve this issue.

      Another example:
      DISCUSSION
      First I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.

      COMMAND
      ```
      ls -a
      ```

      Note, the content of the plan needs to be wrapped with `plan` and `end_of_plan`, enclosed by ```.
      You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response with more discussions. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
      If you'd like to issue two plans or commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

      IMPORTANT TIPS: your job is only to select a plan to resolve the issue and not to create a new plan yourself. DO NOT EDIT THE CODE IN THE REPOSITORY!!!

SETTING: You are a Manager responsible for overseeing a software engineering team. Your team comprises four members: the **Reproducer**, the **Fault Localizer**, the **Editor**, and the **Verifier**. Your primary task is to efficiently solve GitHub issues and ensure smooth collaboration among team members.

you should analyze the given issue, and select a plan from predefined ones, that is, to organize a team, arrange team roles, and designate task processes.
Besides, you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.
The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
open <path> [<line_number>] - opens the file at the given path in the editor. If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line
goto <line_number> - moves the window to show <line_number>
scroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines
scroll_up - moves the window down 100 lines
create <filename> - creates and opens a new file with the given name
search_dir <search_term> [<dir>] - searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory
search_file <search_term> [<file>] - searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file
find_file <file_name> [<dir>] - finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory
rover_search_file <project_path> <file_name> - search for a file named <file_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.
rover_search_class <project_path> <class_name> - search for a class named <class_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.
rover_search_method <project_path> <method_name> - search for a method named <method_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.
rover_search_code <project_path> <code> - search for a code snippet <code> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.
rover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <file_name> <code> - search for a code snippet <code> in <file_name> from the directory <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.
edit <start_line>:<end_line>
<replacement_text>
end_of_edit - replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.
submit - submits your current code and terminates the session
find_test_files [<directory>] - finds and lists all test files in the current or specified directory
warning_pytest - warns the user that pytest should be run on relevant test files only
failed_test_message - strategies to handle failed test cases
update_plan - The plan has been updated.
end_conversation - end the conversation
warning_message_edit - display a warning message
request_new_test_session - request the Debugger/Tester for an independent verification of the current state using both the original and expanded reproduction tests
end_conversation - end the conversation
warning_message_submit_patch - display a warning message
request_submit_patch - request the tester to verify the patch and submit it
warning_message_multiple_code_blocks - Display a warning message about multiple code blocks, including examples of correct formatting as a simple sequence
warning_programmer_pytest - warns the user that pytest should be run on relevant test files only
warning_programmer_rm - please don't remove reproduction script


RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:
(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $

You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.
Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ plan field EXACTLY as in the following example:

IMPORTANT TIPS:
1. If the issue description contains a user provided test but does not contain a set of developer tests, use **Plan A**.

2. If the issue description does not contain a user provided test and a set of developer tests, use **Plan B**.

3. Note, the content of the plan needs to be wrapped with `plan` and `end_of_plan`, enclosed by ```.
You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response with more discussions. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two plans or commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

4. If a plan does not produce an output or fails to execute, consider using another plan.

5. The plan command you have made must be under the COMMAND section, not in the DISCUSSION. Otherwise it will be difficult to extract.

6. You are required to select one of the two presented plans above, NOT DESIGNING A NEW PLAN.

Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.
If you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:
(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $

You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.

DISCUSSION
First I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.
```
ls -a
```

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:
ISSUE:
 JIRA: SNOW-1492371
Migrate application_package_security_review_max.py to Snowfort.

Here are the original SFTest Files:

RegressionTests/regressions/t_native_apps_provider_platform_trust/src/application_package_security_review_max.py.
Original SFTest Ref File:

t_native_apps_provider_platform_trust/ref/application_package_security_review_max.py.ref

Migrate them to Snowfort.



INSTRUCTIONS:
 Your task is to write tests that will help expose any incomplete or insufficient solutions. You will be given source test files in one framework, and your task is to migrate the tests to the new framework, Snowfort.

  Follow these steps:
 1. Examine the issue description. Think about the behavior that should be exhibited by the code that fixes the issue.
 2. Review the existing tests and fixtures. Use the following commands:
 ```
 rover_search_method /__home__repo__snowflake <method_name>
 ```
 ```
 rover_search_code /__home__repo__snowflake <code>
 ```
 IMPORTANT: Based on this, understand the input-output correspondence between the function and the fixture.
 
 2. To understand Snowfort syntax and framework, you can explore and study existing examples of written tests,
 for example : Snowfort/tests/native_apps/provider_platform/trust/test_application_package_security_review_dropping.py

 3. Write down the detailed explanation of your understanding, including:
 * The purpose and behavior of the function being tested
 * The structure and content of the input fixtures (such as np.array)
 * The expected outputs and how they relate to the inputs
 * The current issue and how it affects the function's behavior
 * How the suggested fix would change the function's behavior

 4. After explaining your understanding, create the new files necessary for the new tests.
 
 7. Once you are done, Submit the tests:
 ```
 submit
 ```
 Remember:

 YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for feedback after every command.

 # Using Search Commands for Context

 - `rover_search_file <project_path> <file_name>`
 - `rover_search_class <project_path> <class_name>`
 - `rover_search_method <project_path> <method_name>`
 - `rover_search_code <project_path> <code>`
 - `rover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <file_name> <code>`

 Use these commands to understand related classes, methods, and code snippets relevant to the issue at hand.

 # Navigation and Editing

 - Use `goto <line_number>` for quick navigation
 - Always check the currently open file and working directory
 - Pay attention to indentation when editing
 - Double-check code after each edit command

 Your task is complete when you've finished creating all the tests.

Alright, let's start by identifying the relevant methods and references in the original SFTest file and the new Snowfort test framework. We'll locate the original test file `application_package_security_review_max.py` in the project.

First, we will search for the original test file in the repository.

It seems like there was an issue with the `rover_search_file` command. Let's try searching for the file using a different approach. 

We'll look for the file `application_package_security_review_max.py` within the `RegressionTests` directory.

The original test file contains a setup script and a test function, `run_test`, that performs various setups and executes some tests regarding application package versions and security reviews.

To migrate these tests to Snowfort, we need to follow the Snowfort framework syntax and conventions. Let's start by finding an example Snowfort test file. We'll explore the `Snowfort/tests/native_apps/provider_platform/trust` directory as mentioned in the instructions.

First, let's check the contents of this directory to identify a relevant test file:

We can see the structure and conventions used in the Snowfort test framework. 

### Key Points:
- Snowfort tests utilize decorations like `@SecurityScanner`, `@FeatureArea`, and several others to annotate the tests.
- They use fixtures, mainly `@pytest.fixture`, to set up the environment and provide reusable test elements.
- They utilize API calls through necessary imports for actions like creating, modifying, and checking application packages.

### Steps to Migrate:
1. Use similar annotations as in the existing Snowfort test files.
2. Set up fixtures for reusable components like connections, stages, and application packages.
3. Translate the `run_test` function logic into corresponding Snowfort API calls and checks within a test function.

Now let's create a new file in the Snowfort structure for our migrated test. We will create `test_application_package_security_review_max.py` in the `Snowfort` directory.

We'll start by creating the necessary decorators and basic structure for the test class.

The content looks streamlined now with the necessary imports, class declaration, and fixtures. Next, let's add the test method to simulate the application package security review as it was done in the original file.

We'll include assertions and checks that verify the expected outcomes, mimicking the behavior in the original test.
